# Background and Methodology

Legal changes in Australian workplace laws regarding safety and harassment catalyzed this review. The media's societal role underscores Nine's cultural integrity. The review combined surveys, interviews, submissions, and policy analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment.

# Broadcast Division Findings

The Broadcast Division exhibited pervasive issues stemming from leadership deficiencies, a high-pressure environment, and gendered power dynamics. Women reported significant exposure to harassment and casual sexism. Reporting mechanisms were perceived as ineffective. Recommendations centered on accountability, transparent processes, and enhanced leadership training.

# Whole of Nine Entertainment Findings

# Conclusion

Addressing these systemic issues requires a comprehensive reform strategy led by transparency, leadership commitment, and a focus on a respectful, inclusive workplace culture. Monitoring progress, tackling gender disparities, and reinforcing accountability will be essential for sustained change.
