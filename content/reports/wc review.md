## Executive Summary

The Standing Committee on Law and Justice conducted a review of the NSW workers compensation scheme, focusing particularly on the increase in psychological injury claims. Key findings and recommendations include:

1. The scheme is facing financial sustainability challenges, with declining return to work rates and rising costs, especially for psychological claims.
2. The workers compensation system, originally designed for physical injuries, may not be fit for purpose in dealing with complex psychological claims.
3. There is a need for better data collection, particularly on secondary psychological injuries.
4. Improvements are required in claims management processes, including reducing case manager turnover and minimizing delays in treatment.
5. A comprehensive review of the entire workers compensation scheme is recommended.

## Background

The workers compensation scheme in NSW is the largest defined benefit scheme in Australia, covering over 4.7 million workers. Key bodies include:

- **Insurance and Care NSW (icare)**: Manages the Nominal Insurer and Treasury Managed Fund
- **State Insurance Regulatory Authority (SIRA)**: Regulates the scheme
- **SafeWork NSW**: Workplace health and safety regulator
- **Independent Review Office**: Handles complaints and provides legal assistance

Recent developments include the implementation of recommendations from the 2021 McDougall review and ongoing reforms by icare and SIRA.
